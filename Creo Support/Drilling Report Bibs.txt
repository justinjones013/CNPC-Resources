    abstract = "{Models for the forces required to remove a fixed volume of rock with a single cutter have been applied to different polycrystalline-diamond-compact (PDC) bit designs. The integration of the forces for each cutter over the bit face gives the torque and weight on bit (WOB) required for a particular rate of penetration (ROP). This paper presents the results of comparing such a model to laboratory drilling tests for four radically different bit designs in four different rocks. The geometry of each cutter on the bit was determined by detailed measurements of the bit with a three-axis coordinate measuring machine. Drilling tests were conducted by "reaming" rock with an 8½-in. [21.6-cm] bit that was previously drilled with a 6¼-in. [15.9-cm] bit. Only the peripheral cutters engaged the rock during reaming. Additional tests were conducted in which the WOB and torque were recorded during drilling of a pilot hole into the top of a flat rock and during drilling through two different bed boundaries with constant ROP. The model predictions compared well to the measured data for both the reaming and pilot-hole tests.}",

Cutters on a whirling bit can move sideways, backward, and much faster than those on a true rotating bit.

However, proper operating conditions (i.e. low rotary speed and high weight on bit) and new technology for vibration control (anti-whirl PDC bits and a soft-torque rotary system) can successfully extend the application of PDC bits to harder formations. This conclusion is based on numerical modelling of PDC bit/drillstring assemblies and is supported by recent developments in PDC bit technology and torsional vibration control systems. The PDC bit model is fully dynamic and three-dimensional and is used to simulate normal rotary drilling. Sensitivity analyses of different PDC bit designs show bit-induced torsional, axial and lateral vibrations. Moreover, these analyses show that conventional PDC bits tend to whirl backward, resulting in reduced penetration rates and bit life. Antiwhirl PDC bits effectively reduce this tendency when run under the proper operating conditions of low rotary speed and high weight on bit.}",

    abstract = "{Stick-slip vibrations of drillstrings have been studied by researchers for several decades. The subject is gaining renewed interest as operating parameters for PDC bits have shifted to the stick-slip regime of higher bit weight and lower rotary speed for enhanced drilling performance. In Ledgerwood et al. (2010), stick-slip was identified as a primary cause of bit damage. The main objective of the current investigation is to answer the longstanding question: Do bit designs influence stick-slip behavior of the drilling system? Five prevailing industry perceptions reported in the literature are that anti-whirl bits, reduced exposure bits, and bits with bit-rock interaction number "β" \\&gt; 1 are less prone to stick-slip, while highly aggressive bits and worn bits are more prone to stick-slip. Although the phenomenological basis of these theories has been provided, validation in most cases is based on anecdotal evidence from the field. Data with diagnosis based on downhole measurements in a controlled environment are scarce. Consequently, conflicting opinions continue to exist about whether any of these theories work in reality.To assess their validity, the five leading theories were reviewed and pairs of PDC bits were designed and manufactured. Each pair consisted of a bit with a standard design and a bit that embodied one of the theories. The bits were first tested in the laboratory to characterize their response. Full-scale wells were then drilled under controlled conditions using a research drill rig in Oklahoma. In these wells, only the operating parameters were varied while BHA, formation, and other variables were unchanged for a given bit pair. The downhole vibrations were measured with a new in-bit device and an industry-proven MWD vibration monitoring service.The most important conclusion emerging from this study is that PDC bit design has a significant effect on stick-slip vibrations. While some of the theories held true, evidence from this study did not support others. The details of test results are provided and various aspects of bit design are discussed in an attempt to enhance the understanding of stick-slip mitigation.}",

The general understanding of torsional behavior of drilling systems derived from elaborate efforts in the literature does not explain the mechanism responsible for HFTO. Even for the well-known and extensively studied stick/slip vibrations, the mechanism perpetuating the vibrations is not agreed upon by researchers.The paper discusses findings from experimental and analytical studies regarding the HFTO of bottomhole assemblies (BHAs). The phenomenon is investigated and reproduced in field tests, full-scale laboratory tests, and computer modeling. Drilling conditions are identified in which the drilling system is prone to exhibit the vibrations. Interaction of the bit and the drilling system, which can generate self-excited vibrations, is investigated using analytical methods. Cutter-rock interaction as a possible excitation source is studied using laboratory experiments to elucidate its interaction with the system.The integrated analysis investigating rock, cutter, bit, and BHA interaction identifies HFTO as a bit-induced BHA torsional resonance that can occur at vibration modes higher than the fundamental mode of the BHA. It is demonstrated that modes most susceptible to exhibiting HFTO can be identified and the dominant mode predicted. The understanding gained can be employed to mitigate torsional resonance and enhance drilling performance.}",

    abstract = "{Downhole vibration is detrimental to drilling efficiency and can cause MWD/LWD tool failure, drillstring fatigue, bit/PDM damage. Preventing or mitigating BHA instability is critical to improve drilling efficiency, increase ROP and reduce drilling costs. To prevent dynamic instability requires an in-depth understanding of the BHA's downhole behavior in terms of the actual phenomenon and ability to determine root cause. Downhole RPM and vibration data sent to surface from MWD/LWD usually have very low frequency limited by telemetry. Because vibrations are measured at a distance from the bit, the data may not capture detailed bit behavior patterns. The low frequency data is typically used in combination with steady-state response or static analysis models developed to predict interaction between the drillstring and wellbore. Results produced by these type systems have been less than optimal.To obtain superior quality downhole vibration data, a high-frequency drilling dynamics measurement module (DDMM) was recently developed to capture and measure bit/BHA dynamic response. The authors will describe the application of the new module to measure and record downhole RPM, acceleration at bit/BHA at sampling frequencies up to 2048-Hz. Analysis verified the high-frequency data produces more specific details about dynamic behavior compared to standard data. The module can be positioned at any location within the BHA or directly above the bit.The high-frequency data is used in conjunction with a unique time-based dynamic simulation system to verify and confirm the modeling's prediction of ROP/RPM, acceleration and drillstring instability including stick-slip/whirl. When drilling dysfunction is observed, the time-based modeling system has the potential to ascertain the root cause not typically identified in measured data. This system approach is cost effective and can be highly effective at preventing or mitigating complex instability issues. Three DDMM field tests are presented that document the capability of the combined testing and modeling system approach to achieve better understanding of downhole dynamics:Rotary BHA with one DDMM positioned at top of bit. Analysis of actual downhole data from DDMM shows large RPM variation at the bit which was confirmed by the time-based modeling system. The two data plots showed good correlation between axial/lateral acceleration (acceleration/g's vs time/sec).Motor BHA with two DDMMs installed. One positioned at top of motor another at top of the bit. Analysis of actual data documents stick-slip at the bit and top of motor which is confirmed by the modeling system. Detailed analysis of the two data plots revealed good correlation between actual and modeled data with both depicting negative RPM at the top of the motor with increased acceleration at the occurrence of stick-slip (RPM vs time/sec).Motor BHA with two DDMMs installed. One positioned at top of motor, another at top of bit. Analysis of actual data documents stick slip at the top of motor which was confirmed by the modeling system. Further analysis of the modeling data plot identified stick-slip coupled with BHA whirl.The case studies document accurate modeling predictions of ROP/RPM and acceleration corroborated by the measured data. Modeling also successfully predicted dynamic instability issues identified by actual DDMM measurement and gave specific details about coupling of stick-slip and BHA whirl not observed in the measured data.}",

Generally, drillstring vibration is measured with shock-and-vibration sensors installed in measurement-while-drilling (MWD) tools, logging-while-drilling (LWD) tools, and rotary steerable systems (RSS). Although these tools provide valuable real-time and recorded-mode information on the dynamic conditions, they are not generally designed to capture continuous high-frequency (HF) mechanics and dynamics data, and burst data may miss important information about the evolution of the system response and state.A downhole mechanics measurement tool has been developed that makes a comprehensive suite of measurements of the drilling process, including forces, accelerations, rotational speed, pressures, and temperatures. In addition to providing information in real time, the tool has the capability to capture long durations of continuous data at frequencies between 50 and 2,000 Hz. The recorded-mode information obtained has provided significant insight into the response of the drilling system to starting rotation; drilling procedures and parameter modifications; and exposure to excitation from sources including, but not limited to, rig heave, bottomhole-assembly (BHA) component imbalance, and bit/rock interaction. A wide range of occurrences has been captured in which the drilling system switches from a dominant vibration mode, typically torsional (downhole rotation-velocity oscillations or stick/slip) into a different mode, such as axial (bit bounce) or lateral (whirl). Transitions between different types of whirl have also been recorded.Several cases were studied to investigate the evolution and response of drilling-system behavior on the basis of in-depth interpretation of relatively long durations (minutes to hours) of HF data sets in the operational context. The findings verify the value of using continuous HF vibration data to understand the drilling system and to increase drilling performance.}",

    abstract = "{Historically polycrystalline diamond compact cutters have consisted of a planar cutting face on a cylindrical diamond table. For decades industry has been aware of the potential drilling performance gains from forming these cylindrical cutters into other geometrical shapes. These early generation shaped cutters did not gain traction due to limitations in diamond technology, and high manufacturing costs associated with shaping the cutters. Recently PDC drill bits with shaped cutter designs are becoming more prolific in worldwide drilling applications. Often, the novelty in the design of the cutter shapes is enticing enough to merit opportunities for field runs. However, without an informed understanding of shaped cutter behaviors, there is risk of diminished drilling performance if the cutter shapes are not applied properly to the bit and application. The objective of this paper is to develop methods to evaluate two critical behaviors for shaped PDC cutter designs, overload integrity and aggressivity, and apply these methods to a full bit drilling model.The cutter overload integrity characterization methods are developed using finite element analysis and the aggressivity characterization is based on high pressure visual single point cutter laboratory test data. The information is fed into a full bit drilling numerical model to predict bit performance and ability to avoid cutter breakage in a simulated drilling environment, accounting for factors such as lithology, interbedded transitions, bottom hole assembly type, and operating parameters. The models enable optimization of shaped cutter design and fit for purpose cutter selection.The full bit model is tested and validated against field runs. Case studies include interbedded drilling in the Haynesville and Permian Basins. In both applications, bits were run with different shaped cutter designs, using drilling performance and dull photos to compare to the model outputs. ROP gains of 35\\% were seen in the Haynesville application, while the cutter survival rate more than doubled in the Permian application by using optimally selected shaped cutters.The methods presented in this paper provide new pathways for shaped cutter design and selection. Digital tools are demonstrated to perform the multi-faceted analysis efficiently for pre-well planning and post-run analysis.}",

    abstract = "{Drilling is an essential operation for subsurface hydrocarbon/geothermal energy extraction or underground waste fluid/gas storage. Efficient drilling is the key to an economically viable operation. Axial, torsional, and lateral oscillations that are excited in the drillstring by various surface/downhole sources (like the application of the weight-on-bit (WOB), rock cutting process, bottom-hole-assembly (BHA) resonance, downhole tool operation, drilling fluid dynamics, etc.), are the prime causes of downhole tool failure, material fatigue, bit wear/damage, and insufficient surface-to-bottom energy transfer. Since the 1960s, a wide variety of models have been developed to analyze drillstring dynamics and optimize the well/drillstring design. With the advance of drilling engineering, sensor technology, and data science, a fast and comprehensive drilling system dynamic model is in need for real-time drilling optimization and automation.In this study, a control-oriented physics-based lumped parameter model (LPM) is developed to investigate the fully coupled drillstring dynamics in all three directions. Various boundary conditions (wellbore-drillstring interaction, bit-rock interaction, presence of stabilizers/centralizers) and system input actuations (surface WOB/hookload, surface rotational speed (RPM)/torque, mud motor operational parameters, etc.) are defined in the modeling framework. Simulations are run for different drillstring scenarios in a vertical and an actual L-shaped wellbore configuration. System dynamic responses illustrate various amplitudes, frequencies, and modes of fully coupled drillstring vibrations at different depths when simulated with different drilling parameters. Another significant observation is the emergence, propagation, and transition of lateral vibration modes between forward, backward, and chaotic whirl patterns. Based on the tradeoff between accuracy and complexity, the proposed dynamic model can be adapted for real-time model-based control, and can also be deployed for well design purposes or digital twinning applications.}",
